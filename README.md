# Lotus Yoga Website
The website is created to promote a new vibrant yoga studio and to increase the flow of new students
 as well as to increase students who sign up for the monthly membership.
 Promoting yoga, mindfulness and wellbeing is at the core of Lotus Yoga values.
The Website is accesible on a range of devices making it easy to navigate.

### Design

I tried to keep website design simple and clean,

#### Color Scheme
I tried to stay with warm earthy colors. 
Developing it further I would implement more variety and contrast.
Due to time limits I wasn't able to take experment as much as I would have liked to.
 
 #### Typography
 Logo was created using "Poiret One" (fallback "cursive") to minimalistic and modern look. 
 For the paragraphs I've used "Roboto" with fall back "sans serif" and 
 the main headings "Abel" to be contrasting with the Logo design,
  "sans serif" was used for the headings as a fall back font as well.

#### Imagery
Images on the website are inviting. Large Hero images on the landing page
are in slideshow and grabs your attention staright away. Inviting you to the studio.

Most of the pictures used are of yoga teachers and students in the class or yoga poses.
Allowing the user to picture themselves in their place and get a better idea what to expect.

### Wireframes

In the wireframes available there are extra sections that may be implement
as the Yoga Studio grows. As I went on to design i had to leave out certain parts.
