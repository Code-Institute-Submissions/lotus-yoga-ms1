# Lotus Yoga Website

[View live website here.](https://dovi-k.github.io/lotus-yoga-ms1/)

![Responsive Image](assets/additional_images/responsive.png)

The website is created to promote a new vibrant yoga studio and to increase the flow of new students
 as well as to increase students who sign up for the monthly membership.

 Promoting yoga, mindfulness and wellbeing is at the core of Lotus Yoga values.

The Website is accesible on a range of devices making it easy to navigate. 







## User Experience (UX)

<p>I've tried to make the navigation as simple as possible. 
The navigation bar has a fixed position
so when you are scrolling through the pages you can easlily access it.</p>
<p>Each page is not overloaded with text. Fot the teachers section I've used 
collapse function to keep it visually pleasing to the viewvers eye.
 </p>
 <p> Membership information is displayed in the Welcome page inviting users to sign up or try their
 first class with the studio for free.</p>
 <p>Contact form has it's own page and it's easily accesible to the students. </p>

### Design

I tried to keep website design simple and clean. 

#### Color Scheme
I tried to stay with warm earthy colors. 
Developing it further I would implement more variety and contrast.
Due to time limits I wasn't able to take experment as much as I would have liked to.
 
 #### Typography
 Logo was created using "Poiret One" (fallback "cursive") to minimalistic and modern look. 
 For the paragraphs I've used "Roboto" with fall back "sans serif" and 
 the main headings "Abel" to be contrasting with the Logo design,
  "sans serif" was used for the headings as a fall back font as well.

#### Imagery
Images on the website are inviting. Large Hero images on the landing page
are in slideshow and grabs your attention staright away. Inviting you to the studio.

Most of the pictures used are of yoga teachers and students in the class or yoga poses.
Allowing the user to picture themselves in their place and get a better idea what to expect.

All images were taken from the free stock photos websites:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* [Pexabay](https://pixabay.com/images/)
* The only picture taken from personal portfolio is in Wecome page
 Teacher section (Dovile) picture was taken by Barry Gibons</li>
The technology used for pictures was Paint 3D I used Resizing pictures to 
so that tehy would nicely align in the class section and teachers section as I had a 
difficulty at first wanting to make them in a circle but because of their parameters 
the pictures were distorted.

### Wireframes

In the wireframes available there are extra sections that may be implement
as the Yoga Studio grows. As I went on to design I had to leave out certain parts.

* [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/tabletwireframe.pdf)

## Features to implement

Going ahead with the yoga studio the website design would be slightly asjusted.
Also site is not fully functional.


- Making the contact page live and functional
- Use of a CNAME (Canonical Name) URL
- Creating classes online booking system
-  Adding payment options
- Adding google maps to the contact page with the studio location.
- Making contact page live
- Adding functionality to all the buttons
- Going forward with the project and the studio I would like to create 
members log in and special functions for members.
- Adding shopping page for studio merch items like yoga mats, towels, water bottles with the brand
to the page.

## Bugs to fix
- fixing the responsiveness on diffrent devices. The websites still
needs quite a lot of work on that.
- the main image is taking too much space of on the main HOME page.
I would fit so you owuld see full view of teh image slidehow without having
to scroll down a little bit.
- margins-left for the images in classes.html the gap is slightly too big.
and then when that page is resizes give the images some bottom margin to give space between
text and the images.
- timetable responsiveness
- memberships respinsiveness 
- adding the href to The Memberships so you oudl be brought directly to 
the Membership section of the timetable.html instead of being just brought
into timetable.html
- footer it moves up depending on the responsiveness
- contact form adjust alignments with the adress information
- the menu bar is hidden on the left side on different devices
