            <p class="quote">
              “Yoga is not about being flexible. Yoga is about showing up on
              your mat daily with no expectations of how it should go. It’s not
              about believing the labels like “too injured” or “too old” and
              finding a new way to be the best version of yourself. Yoga is a
              lifestyle not an exercise program, although yoga has no judgement
              if you only want to use the poses to exercise. Yoga is about
              discovering that those crazy thoughts in your head about why you
              can’t or shouldn’t are not true. It is about slowing down and
              seeking something greater than yourself. Yoga is more than what
              you wear or if you can handstand. YOGA IS THE ULTIMATE PRACTICE OF
              LOVE.” <em> -Kerri Verna </em>
